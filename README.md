# Intro
This is a work-in-progress emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System, written in Rust. This project primarily exists as a learning experience for me and I do not know if/when it will be complete.
# Project Status
The emulator currently runs Donkey Kong. In theory, it should also run any other game that doesn't require any of the items/features in the Project TODO section. So far, I've only tested Donkey Kong.
